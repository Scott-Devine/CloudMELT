# CloudMELT / dev

This directory contains preliminary versions of various pieces of the
CloudMELT code, along with run scripts and timing results for the tool
as it evolved. Once the overall architecture had stabilized these older
scripts were moved into dev/ and git was used to track all further
changes.
